"If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method
to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?"

Answer: No.
If we implement like the following:

public DigitalVideoDisc(String title) {
    // code here
}

public DigitalVideoDisc(String category) {
    // code here
}

Java won't recognize title and category as different just by their names.
In fact, constructor overloading is allowed in case if the number of formal parameters are different or
if the number of formal parameters is the same but with different datatypes.

Meanwhile, title and category are of the same datatype.
